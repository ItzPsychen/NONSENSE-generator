## *The Application*

The *NONSENSE-generator* is an application that lets you create an **infinite amount of sentences** without any logical reason. You can use it to analyze sentences you type in, visualize the syntactic tree of any kind of phrase, or even to know the levels of toxicity and more!

The Application provides to the user a simple and user-friendly interface provided with a form. Here you will have the opportunity to type a sentence of your own and play with it. By analyzing and generating, you can create different new fancy sentences. As a user, you will also have the possibility to personalize the generating methods and strategies by selecting what kind of structures and words to use.

All this comes with *customizable* settings. Here you can choose themes, where to get your input and output files, and also expand our vocabulary of words, which we use to make better and more complicated sentences.

At the beginning we will show you what the settings will be. Here you have access to the path where everything is *got* and *saved*.

#### 1. **Setting the API key**

We will ask you, user, to set your personal path of the API key inside the appropriate space provided at the top of the settings. Once done, just *Apply* and get started.

#### 2. **Get Started with the Generator**

After setting all the needed information, you now have full access to the application. You can now use the generator as you wish without any problem of losing what you generated, by using the *Save* option that puts everything you do into an output file. All settings are also saved so that they don't revert to default once you close the app. 

#### 3. **Exit the Application**

The user can simply use our provided *"Exit"* button on top of the form, without any problem of losing their data about what they generated.

#### 4. **Credits**

At the top of our Generator, you can open a *Credits* section using the *"About"* button. Here you can see the team with all the names of the developers.

## *The All-Functions Manual*

The following section provides a detailed breakdown of the Application, so that you won't get lost using it in the future.

- **Analyze** button
  
  By entering a sentence and analyzing it, you will be provided with the structure of the sentence, along with the syntactic tree if the user wants to.

- **Generate** button
  
  This is the main button, used to create our nonsense sentences. You, user, have at your disposal a complete menu where you can choose from multiple options how to generate the sentences.

- **Menu Options** for generating
  
  The *Sentence Structure* section lets you choose if you want the application to choose it randomly, maintain the same one used from the input, or choose one yourself. From the settings, you can even make it *recursive*.  
  The *Word Generation* section has two options: the first will make our Generator use new words you did not type in, while the second will make your generated result in future tense.

- **Use Generated** button
  
  This simple button will re-use your generated sentence as a new input by writing it in the input-text section. Now the previous generation can be analyzed and used again as you wish.

- **Toxicity** bars
   
  These five bars will help you visualize better at what level of toxicity, profanity, insult, sexual and political content your generated sentence is at. The lower the level, the more green they become; the higher they get, the more red they will be.

- **Save** option
    
  This checkbox, if selected, will automatically take all your future generated sentences and one by one add them to a file that will never be deleted automatically by the Application. In this file, you will always have the possibility to check your previously created sentences.

- **Settings**
  
  The Settings option, found under *File*, will open a new form where you can change the paths of many files. At the bottom, the user can change the recursion level (previously cited), disable it, set the maximum length of an input sentence and finally change the theme (light/dark).

- **Vocabulary**
  
  This form, which you can open with the *Vocabulary* option under *Edit*, will let you add all the nouns, verbs and adjectives you want so that the Generator in the future can use the new words you provided.

- **About**
   
  The Credits section explained as before. You can find this by going to the *Help* option and then *About*.
